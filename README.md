# Toxic Release Inventory(TRI) ELT/Analysis:

## A fully functional project written in Python that creates a TRI  Database Model and a Data Extraction Pipeline to insert clean data into the TRI database for further Analysis.

### This goal of this project is answer questions such as:

1. What facility was involved in dumping the most?
    * 


### Visualization:
1. Line chart depicting the trends of waste dumped by Top 10 facility(with the most toxic waste dumped) throughout the years.

    1. Top 10 Facility:

Process used:
* Used SQLAlchemy ORM(Object Relational Mapping) to generate Tables and Column for the TRI Database. 
* Used requests to connect to the TRI metadata API endpoints and extracted raw data from it 
* Used the raw data and transformed them into Pandas DataFrame with
necessary columns needed for the TRI Database.
* Cleaned up the data in the Pandas DataFrame to make it ready for DataBase insertion. 
* Then finally used the SQLAlchemy Postgresql Dialects to create an Upsert logic to avoid duplicate entries or errors during the insertion process. 
* Extra: Used Alembic autogeneration for automatic Database Migrations.
